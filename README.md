# Cypress Automated Testing Suite

End-to-end automated testing suite built with **Cypress** for web application UI and functional validation. Implements the **Page Object Model (POM)** for scalable architecture, supports data-driven testing, and captures screenshots/videos on failures. Designed for seamless CI/CD integration and efficient regression coverage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dineshk1324/cypress-tests.git
cd cypress-tests
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed (version 16+ recommended). Then install required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Interactive mode:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

Opens the Cypress Test Runner GUI to run tests interactively.

### Headless mode:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

Runs all tests in the terminal without a browser UI. Generates:

* Videos → `cypress/videos`
* Screenshots (on failures) → `cypress/screenshots`

---

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Configure `baseUrl` and other environment variables in `cypress.config.js`:

```javascript
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress");

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: "https://example.com",
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      // custom tasks here
    },
  },
});
```

---

## 📊 Test Reports

If using **Mochawesome**:

```bash
npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome
```

Reports are saved in:

```
/cypress/reports
```

If you want, I can also **add `.gitignore` and a GitHub Actions workflow** so your repo is CI/CD ready instantly. That would make it look like a production-level automation project.
